## On-chain Smart Escrow Findings (Axx)

### Dispute resolver and platform can call with arbitrary trustless_work_address and redirect TW fees to another address

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

Some public Smart Escrow functions accept the parameter `trustless_work_address: Address`, which is the address where the Smart Escrow sends the Trustless Work fees. The two functions that accept this parameter are `resolve_dispute` and `release_funds`, both of which do not validate the address. This means that the caller of the functions can send an arbitrary address instead of the actual Trustless Work address, thereby allowing the redirection of Trustless Work fees to an unintended recipient.

However, both `resolve_dispute` and `release_funds` are access-restricted. In the case of `release_funds`, only the `release_signer` can sign the function call, while for `resolve_dispute`, only the `dispute_resolver` can sign the function call.

## Recommendation
We recommend hard-coding the address of Trustless Work into the Smart Contract or using some other secure method to query the address at runtime.

## Status
The client has addressed this finding by hard-coding the Trustless Work address into the contract and using it internally instead of requiring it as an input parameter. The modification was already implemented in another version of the contract, which was deployed for testing.


### Maximum relative amount of fees not checked at initialization time

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The Smart Escrow initialization function does not check whether the fees exceed a maximum amount.

There are two kinds of fees: the `trustless_work_fee` and the `platform_fee`. The `trustless_work_fee` is set to a fixed value at Smart Contract compilation time, while the `platform_fee` is passed as a parameter at Smart Contract initialization time. Both fees are relative to the total amount of funds managed by the Smart Escrow. The fees are specified in the unit BPS, which stands for basis points with one unit being equal to 0.01%.

In case the sum of both fees exceeds 100%, the funds will be locked in the Smart Escrow. This is due to the Smart Contract attempting a transfer with a negative amount after deducting a relative fee of over 100%. Typically, token implementations revert on transfers with negative amounts. In this case, the funds will be locked in the Smart Escrow. E.g., for `resolve_dispute`, the following code computes the fees and net amount for `approver`:

```rust
let trustless_work_fee = SafeMath::safe_mul_div(
    total_resolved_funds,
    TRUSTLESS_WORK_FEE_BPS,
    BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR,
)?;
let platform_fee = SafeMath::safe_mul_div(
    total_resolved_funds,
    platform_fee_bps,
    BASIS_POINTS_DENOMINATOR,
)?;
let total_fees = BasicMath::safe_add(trustless_work_fee, platform_fee)?;
let net_approver_funds = if total_resolved_funds > 0 {
    let approver_fee_share =
        SafeMath::safe_mul_div(approver_funds, total_fees, total_resolved_funds)?;
    BasicMath::safe_sub(approver_funds, approver_fee_share)?
} else {
    0
};
```

Here, the variable `net_approver_funds` will be negative in case `total_fees` is bigger than `total_resolved_funds`.

## Recommendation
We recommend that during both initialization and Smart Escrow update, the sum of the `trustless_work_fee` and `platform_fee` is validated to be less than 100%.

## Status
This finding has been addressed in commit ID [`1da344e`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/1da344e) in branch `single-release-develop`.


### Initialization possible with pre-approved milestones

Severity: Medium  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

At initialization, an `Escrow` object is passed that defines the Smart Escrow properties, including the details of the milestones. For this purpose, the passed `Escrow` struct is validated with the function `validate_initialize_escrow_conditions`.

This function does not check whether any passed milestone already has the `approved` flag set to `true`. This allows the contract initializer to circumvent the `approver` role.

## Recommendation
We recommend to either:
- validate during initialization and smart escrow update that the passed `Escrow` object has all `approved` flags set to `false`
- override during initialization and smart escrow update the passed `Escrow` object and set all `approved` flags to `false`

## Status
This finding has been partially addressed in commit ID [`6d979b5`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/6d979b5) in branch `single-release-develop`.


### Bypass of the Escrow Initialization Validations

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Partially addressed by client

At initialization, an `Escrow` struct is passed that defines the Smart Escrow properties. For this purpose, the passed `Escrow` struct is validated with the function `validate_initialize_escrow_conditions`. When initializing an instance of a Smart Escrow, using the `initialize_escrow` endpoint, prior to definition of the escrow state, the contract business logic enforces that it is initialized before, that the payment amount of the escrow is not zero, and that the escrow cannot have more than 10 milestones.

Additionally, the `platform` role may update the Escrow properties with the public function `update_escrow`, as long as no funds have been stored yet, no milestones have been approved, and no dispute is present. This is similarly done by passing a new `Escrow` struct that defines the new Smart Escrow properties.

However, in contrast to the initialization, no validation is performed on the passed `Escrow` struct.

Notice that, even though the initialization endpoint and the update endpoint have extremely similar purposes (modifying the escrow state), the set of validations performed by each endpoint is different. This creates opportunities for unpredictable behaviors, as, for instance, an escrow can be updated to have more than 10 milestones, even though its initialization enforces that this shouldn't be possible. Similarly, an escrow can be updated for its amount to be zero, even though its initialization enforces that this shouldn't be possible.

## Recommendation
We recommend to use the same function `validate_initialize_escrow_conditions` that is used during initialization to validate the Escrow properties in the `update_escrow` function.

## Status
This finding has been partially addressed in finding [`6d979b5`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/6d979b5) in branch `single-release-develop`. `validate_escrow_property_change_conditions` and `validate_initialize_escrow_conditions` still have distinct implementations.


### Front-running attack by a malicious platform on fund_escrow with update_escrow

Severity: High  
Difficulty: High  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

A user can fund the Smart Escrow by utilizing the Smart Escrow public function `fund_escrow`. For this purpose, the user only needs to specify the amount of tokens to deposit.

The `platform` role may change the Smart Escrow properties, provided no funds have been deposited, no milestones approved, and no dispute is ongoing. This can be done by executing the Smart Escrow public function `update_escrow`.

This allows a malicious `platform` actor to try to front-run a pending user transaction that executes the `fund_escrow` with an `update_escrow` transaction. This would result in a user funding a Smart Escrow that has been changed since the `fund_escrow` has been signed.

In particular, the changeable properties include the roles, meaning the malicious `platform` actor could change the roles and subsequently steal the funds.

## Recommendation
Require the user to specify the `Escrow` struct as a parameter in `fund_escrow` and validate in `fund_escrow` that the passed `Escrow` struct matches the stored `Escrow` struct. In case of a mismatch, revert, as the user might not want to fund a Smart Escrow with different properties.

## Status
This finding has been addressed in commit ID [`6d979b5`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/6d979b5) in branch `single-release-develop`.


### Smart Escrow uses signed integer type i128 without sign checks

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Partially addressed by client

The Smart Escrow uses the `i128` type for multiple attributes, but is missing sign checks at different locations. This allows for negative parameters to be passed to Smart Escrow public functions and Smart Escrow attributes. On this topic, we highlight:

1. `platform_fee`

In particular, the Smart Escrow uses `i128` for the constant `TRUSTLESS_WORK_FEE_BPS` and the Smart Escrow attribute `platform_fee`. While `TRUSTLESS_WORK_FEE_BPS` is a constant and guaranteed to be positive, `platform_fee` is initialized by `initialize_escrow` or `update_escrow`. While `update_escrow` is currently missing validation for escrow properties entirely, as outlined in [A04] Bypass of the Escrow Initialization Validations, initialization does validate properties generally. However, it is not checked at initialization time whether the `platform_fee` is negative.

This means that a Smart Contract user can specify a negative `platform_fee` that cannot be changed anymore once funds are transferred to the Smart Escrow. In this case, the funds would be locked in the Smart Escrow, as both `release_funds` and `resolve_dispute` would revert when attempting to transfer the negative amount of relative platform fees.

2. `fund_escrow` parameter `amount_to_deposit`

Typically, tokens revert on a negative amount parameter, but this behavior might vary as Soroban tokens specifically use `i128`, in case a token wants to implement functionality for negative balances and similar. Therefore, this revert behavior of tokens should not be relied upon. The Smart Escrow public function `fund_escrow` accepts the parameter `amount_to_deposit: i128` and passes that value to transfer of a token specified in the Smart Escrow attribute `trustline`. As previously outlined, the Smart Escrow should not rely on tokens reverting to negative numbers and should check whether the given `amount_to_deposit` is negative.

3. `resolve_dispute` allows negative funds parameters

The Smart Escrow public function `resolve_dispute` allows negative values for both `approver_funds` and `receiver_funds`. While it is checked that the sum `approver_funds + receiver_funds` is equal to the balance of the Smart Escrow, this check does not cover the case where one of the parameters is negative, while the other is larger than `balance`, such that the sum still equals the Smart Escrow `balance`.

4. `amount`

The Smart Escrow attribute `amount: i128` specifies the amount to be released in `release_funds` and is initialized in either `initialize_escrow` or `update_escrow`. While `update_escrow` is currently missing validation for escrow properties entirely, as outlined in [A04] Bypass of the Escrow Initialization Validations, initialization does validate properties generally. Though it is not checked at initialization time whether the `amount` is negative. This means that a negative `amount` attribute could be specified during initialization that cannot be changed later on once funds have been transferred to the Smart Escrow. A negative `amount` attribute can cause `release_funds` to revert.

5. `milestone_index` parameter

The Smart Escrow uses the signed integer type `i128` as the type for the `milestone_index` parameter for multiple contract functions. While there are either explicit or implicit bound checks in-place, negative milestone indices might overflow when cast to an unsigned integer.

## Recommendation
For handling the discussed topics above, our recommendations are, respectively:

1. We suggest that validation of the `platform_fee` attribute during initialization and escrow update prevents negative values. Furthermore, we suggest that the type of `platform_fee` and `TRUSTLESS_WORK_FEE_BPS` be changed to a smaller unsigned integer type, such as `u16`, as the fee attributes have a maximum value as well, which is expected to be less than 10,000 and can therefore be safely represented by a `u16`.
2. We suggest that a check is added in `fund_escrow` that validates that `amount_to_deposit` is greater than zero.
3. Add additional checks in `resolve_dispute` that validate that both `approver_funds` and `receiver_funds` are non-negative.
4. We suggest that validation of the `amount` attribute during initialization and escrow update prevents negative values.
5. Change the signed integer type to an unsigned integer type for `milestone_index`.

## Status
This finding has been partially addressed in commit IDs [`6d979b5`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/6d979b5), [`58539ca`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/58539ca), and [`33bfafb`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/33bfafb) in branch `single-release-develop`. Regarding topic 4, the approach used to address the issue was to implement an enforcement that the funding amount should be greater than or equal to `0` when handling escrow via the fund endpoint. Although this is effective for handling the escrow in its intended usage, an escrow can still be initialized with a negative amount. To prevent issues related to this altogether, all instances where `Escrow.amount` is used should be validated against negative values, or more simply, the `Escrow` struct should use an unsigned type for `amount`.


### The Approver Can Disapprove Milestones

Severity: Low  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Design  
Status: Addressed by client

The Smart Escrow contract contains a design flaw that exposes it to a griefing attack by the `Approver`. While the `Approver`'s role is to approve milestones, the `approve_milestone` function allows them to both approve and disapprove milestones using a boolean flag, defined by the `new_flag` parameter. This is a problem because it enables the `Approver` to maliciously change the state of an already approved milestone, effectively reverting its status and disrupting the entire escrow process. This behavior does not result in any direct financial gain for the `Approver` but causes significant harm to other parties, particularly the `service_provider`, by hindering their progress and preventing funds from being released.

While this is not a critical vulnerability resulting in direct fund loss, it remains a serious design flaw. A griefing attack is where an actor uses a system's intended features to disrupt without gaining a direct financial advantage. By disapproving a previously approved milestone, the `Approver` can stall the project indefinitely, causing frustration, delaying payments, and, in the case of a multi-source funds escrow, potentially causing the entire crowdsourcing effort to fail. Since the protocol's lifecycle depends on milestones being approved, the ability to revert a milestone's status creates a single point of failure and a denial of service vector for the contract's functionality, which still can be handled by forcing a dispute.

## Recommendation
We recommend modifying the `approve_milestone` function to prevent this type of attack by removing the `new_flag` parameter or enforcing that it is always set to `true`. Design-wise, suppose a legitimate `Approver` notices a problem with a previously approved milestone. In that case, they can still invoke a dispute, forcing the intervention of an authority that can investigate the issue.

## Status
This finding has been addressed commit IDs [`fe2623f`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/fe2623f) and [`2b31f1e`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/2b31f1e) in branch `single-release-develop`.


### Exceeding Assets Will Be Permanently Locked in The Multi-Release Smart Escrows

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

When dealing with the release of its funds, the Single-Release version of the Smart Escrow expects a pre-determined amount to be withdrawn via the `release_funds` endpoint or the total balance of the escrow via the `resolve_dispute` endpoint. If the escrow holds an excess balance beyond the expected amount, the dispute mechanism can be used to handle it.

For the Multi-Release Smart Escrow, funds are released on a milestone basis, with pre-determined amounts per milestone. The dispute method, which is also per milestone, ensures that the disputed value cannot be greater than the pre-determined amount to be released for that milestone. This means that the sum of values released via hypothetical disputes is the same as the amount released through the proper release method, indicating that, if the balance of the Multi-Release Smart Escrow is bigger than the amount expected to be released, the exceeding assets cannot be withdrawn. These tokens will be permanently locked in the contract.

The caveat here comes from finding [A09] Milestones can both be released and dispute-resolved in the multi-release smart escrows, which considers that a milestone can both be released and disputed, meaning that, although incorrectly, the redeemable exceeding balance of a Multi-Release Smart Escrow, in its current state, can be at most the same as its expected release value.

## Recommendation
The Multi-Release Smart Escrow should implement an additional endpoint exclusively for the `dispute_resolver`, which works similarly to `resolve_dispute` in the Single-Release escrow. This endpoint should work on the condition that all milestones must have either been released or dispute-resolved. Alternatively, the limitations on the withdrawn amounts can be removed, but this introduces the issue of being able to withdraw the full balance of an escrow through a single milestone dispute.

## Status
This finding has been addressed in commit ID [`2f6ef92`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/2f6ef92) in branches `multi-receiver`, `multi-release-develop`, `multi-release-main`, and `stellar-multi-release-audit`.


### Milestones can both be released and dispute-resolved in the multi-release smart escrows

Severity: Medium  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

In the multi-release smart escrows, amounts are released on a per-milestone basis. Each milestone defines a specific amount to be released upon completion. At the same time, the smart contract limits the amount that can be released during a milestone dispute resolution to at most that value specified in the respective milestone.

There are no mechanisms in place that disallow a milestone dispute resolution after a milestone has been released. Additionally, there are also no mechanisms that disallow a milestone release after a milestone dispute resolution. Therefore, up to twice the amount specified per milestones can be released per milestone, draining the funds of the smart escrow that are allocated for other milestones.

In the single-release smart escrow, this is a deliberate design decision that allows withdrawal of exceeding funds. Though this design is not suited for a smart escrow with multiple releases of funds.

## Recommendation
Add validations that enforce that dispute-resolved milestones cannot be released as well as that released milestones cannot be dispute-resolved.

There is another issue that can cause funds to be permanently locked in the multi-release smart escrows, described in [A08] Exceeding Assets Will Be Permanently Locked in The Multi-Release Smart Escrows. The recommended fix reduces the amount of funds that can be recovered from the smart escrow when locked by the issue described in [A08] Exceeding Assets Will Be Permanently Locked in The Multi-Release Smart Escrows. Therefore it is heavily recommended to implement the recommendations from finding [A08] Exceeding Assets Will Be Permanently Locked in The Multi-Release Smart Escrows.

## Status
This finding has been addressed in commit ID [`bbdfcc4`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/bbdfcc4) in branch `multi-receiver`, `multi-release-develop`, `multi-release-main`, and `stellar-multi-release-audit`.

## Informative On-chain Findings (Bxx)

### Gas optimizations

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

Here are some notes on the protocol's particularities, comments, and suggestions to improve the code or the business logic of the protocol in a best-practice sense. They do not present issues with the audited protocol themselves. Still, they are advised to either be aware of or to follow when possible.

**token_client.balance(&contract_address) called twice in core/dispute.rs:46**

The gas costs can be optimized by storing the result of the first invocation of `token_client.balance(&contract_address)` in `core/dispute.rs:46` and replacing the second invocation with the cached result.

```rust
if token_client.balance(&contract_address) < total_funds {
    return Err(ContractError::InsufficientFundsForResolution);
}

let fee_result = FeeCalculator::calculate_dispute_fees(
    approver_funds,
    receiver_funds,
    escrow.platform_fee as i128,
    total_funds,
)?;

let current_balance = token_client.balance(&contract_address);
```

**Redundant out-of-bounds check of milestone index**

The function `change_milestone_status` uses the function `validate_milestone_status_change_conditions` to validate some properties, including that the index is within bounds, see `validators/milestone.rs:19-21`:

```rust
if milestone_index < 0 || milestone_index >= escrow.milestones.len() as i128 {
    return Err(ContractError::InvalidMileStoneIndex);
}
```

This check is unnecessary, as the property is already validated in the function `change_milestone_status`, see `core/milestone.rs:30-33`:

```rust
let mut milestone_to_update = existing_escrow
    .milestones
    .get(milestone_index as u32)
    .ok_or(ContractError::InvalidMileStoneIndex)?;
```

The function `change_milestone_status` is the only function that calls the validation function `validate_milestone_status_change_conditions`. Afterwards, the parameter `milestone_index` can be removed as well. Similarly, the functions `change_milestone_approved_flag` and `validate_milestone_flag_change_conditions` can be optimized in the same manner, see `validators/milestone.rs:40-42` and `core/milestone.rs:62-65`.

**Empty milestones checks outside of Escrow initialization and update**

Currently, it is not checked at initialization (see [B02] Initialization possible with zero milestones) whether the configured Smart Escrow milestone vector is empty. Additionally, updating a Smart Escrow also does not validate (see [A04] Bypass of the Escrow Initialization Validations) the passed Smart Escrow properties. Once these findings have been addressed, and respective milestone emptiness checks added to both Smart Escrow initialization and Smart Escrow update, any other emptiness checks can be removed from this Smart Contract.

There are three instances where the milestones are checked for emptiness:
- in `validate_release_conditions` at `validators/escrow.rs:21-23`
- in `validate_milestone_status_change_conditions` at `validators/milestone.rs:15-17`
- in `validate_milestone_flag_change_conditions` at `validators/milestone.rs:36-38`

Each of these three cases reverts if the milestone list is empty, see e.g. `validators/escrow.rs:21-23`:

```rust
if escrow.milestones.is_empty() {
    return Err(ContractError::NoMileStoneDefined);
}
```

**Unused admin**

The `admin` address that is set in `EscrowContract::__constructor` in instance storage with key `DataKey::Admin` is unused. Therefore the `admin` could be removed entirely from the Smart Contract.

**Unnecessary use of the function clone**

The codebase makes use of `.clone()` to pass objects with ownership at function invocations at several places that instead can or could use an immutable borrow instead. This could potentially optimize the efficiency of the contract.

E.g., at `contract.rs:46`, a clone of `e: Env` is passed with ownership, because the invoked function `initialize_escrow` currently declares the parameter `e: Env`. This parameter, and subsequent invoked functions, can be changed to `e: &Env` instead.

**Conditional at core/escrow.rs:17-21**

The function `get_receiver` at `core/escrow.rs:17-21` implements a function to retrieve the receiver unnecessarily complicated. The following implementation could be replaced with a simpler one:

```rust
#[inline]
pub fn get_receiver(escrow: &Escrow) -> Address {
    if escrow.roles.receiver == escrow.roles.service_provider {
        escrow.roles.service_provider.clone()
    } else {
        escrow.roles.receiver.clone()
    }
}
```

Replace the above code with the code below:

```rust
#[inline]
pub fn get_receiver(escrow: &Escrow) -> Address {
    escrow.roles.receiver.clone()
}
```

**Remove signer used in core/escrow.rs:102**

The parameter `signer` in the Smart Escrow public function `get_multiple_escrow_balances` could be removed. It is solely used in `EscrowManager::get_multiple_escrow_balances` at `core/escrow.rs:102` to authenticate the transaction, while the `signer` is not further validated. This use of `require_auth` can be removed.

**Disallow resolve_dispute with total_funds = 0**

Currently, the Smart Escrow public function `resolve_dispute` allows for the sum of the parameters `approver_funds + receiver_funds` to be equal to zero. This serves no purpose, as resolving a dispute with a Smart Escrow balance of zero does not transfer any assets. At the same time, `resolve_dispute` implements additional checks at `calculators.rs:85-91` and `calculators.rs:93-99` to avoid dividing by zero in case the divisor `total_resolved_funds` is zero. This check can be removed by additionally validating that the sum is greater than zero.

**Unnecessary checks in resolve_dispute**

These checks are performed in `validators/dispute.rs:31-37` for `resolve_dispute` that are redundant, as long as [A06] Smart Escrow uses signed integer type i128 without sign checks is resolved. [A06] Smart Escrow uses signed integer type i128 without sign checks discusses, among other things, that the fee attributes, including `platform_fee`, might be negative. For this optimization, fees must not be allowed to be negative.

```rust
if approver_funds < fee_result.net_approver_funds {
    return Err(ContractError::InsufficientApproverFundsForCommissions);
}

if receiver_funds < fee_result.net_receiver_funds {
    return Err(ContractError::InsufficientServiceProviderFundsForCommissions);
}
```

The `net_approver_funds = approver_funds - approver_fees <= approver_funds` always holds, as long as the fees are never negative as previously discussed, due to `calculators.rs:85-91`:

```rust
let net_approver_funds = if total_resolved_funds > 0 {
    let approver_fee_share =
        SafeMath::safe_mul_div(approver_funds, total_fees, total_resolved_funds)?;
    BasicMath::safe_sub(approver_funds, approver_fee_share)?
} else {
    0
};
```

The same holds for `receiver_funds`, akin to `approver_funds`.

**Iterative creation of Soroban vectors instead of patching in-place**

Soroban vectors are stored in the host-environment as immutable vectors. Therefore, each mutation of a vector incurs an overhead. The multi-release smart escrow updates the flags of a single milestone by copying previous milestones iteratively into a new empty vector and changing the flags of the respective milestone simultaneously. Considering the aforementioned overhead of Soroban vectors, this is less efficient than changing the respective milestone in-place.

See e.g. `contracts/escrow/src/core/dispute.rs:113` or `contracts/escrow/src/core/escrow.rs:63`:

```rust
let mut updated_milestones = Vec::new(&e);
for (index, milestone) in escrow.milestones.iter().enumerate() {
    let mut new_milestone = milestone.clone();
    if index as i128 == milestone_index {
        new_milestone.flags.disputed = true;
    }
    updated_milestones.push_back(new_milestone);
}
```

Consider refactoring to use instead in-place mutation of the existing milestones vector.

**Unnecessary write to storage**

The multi-release smart escrow writes an unchanged escrow to storage in the smart contract function `fund_escrow`. Consider removing this redundant write:

```rust
let escrow = EscrowManager::get_escrow(e.clone())?;
let token_client = TokenClient::new(&e, &escrow.trustline.address);

token_client.transfer(&signer, &e.current_contract_address(), &amount_to_deposit);

e.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Escrow, &escrow);
```

**Unused enumerator iterator and vector length check in for loop**

The multi-release smart escrow uses for loops with enumerator iterators without using the provided enumerator index. Additionally, the for loop is wrapped in a redundant conditional that checks whether the vector that is being iterated on is empty. Consider removing the enumerator as well as the redundant vector emptiness check.

See e.g. `contracts/escrow/src/core/validators/escrow.rs:49` or `contracts/escrow/src/core/validators/escrow.rs:80`:

```rust
if !milestones.is_empty() {
    for (_, milestone) in milestones.iter().enumerate() {
        if milestone.flags.disputed {
            return Err(ContractError::MilestoneOpenedForDisputeResolution);
        }
        if milestone.flags.approved {
            return Err(ContractError::MilestoneApprovedCantChangeEscrowProperties);
        }
    }
}

### Initialization possible with zero milestones

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

At initialization, an `Escrow` struct is passed that defines the Smart Escrow properties, including the number and details of the milestones. For this purpose, the passed `Escrow` struct is validated with the function `validate_initialize_escrow_conditions`.

This function checks whether a maximum length that is hardcoded to `10` is not exceeded. However, it does not check whether the milestones vector is empty.

A Smart Escrow with no milestones serves no purpose, and the funds cannot be paid out with `release_funds` either, as this function checks whether the milestone vector is empty. As the other function to retrieve funds, `resolve_dispute`, does not check the length of the milestones vector, so funds are not locked in such a Smart Contract. They can still be retrieved with `resolve_dispute`, albeit with fees.

## Recommendation
We recommend validating during initialization and Smart Escrow update that the milestone vector is not empty.

## Status
This finding has been addressed in commit [`ecbe0be`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/ecbe0be) in the branch `develop`.


### At initialization, the decimals attribute of Trustline is not validated

Severity: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The Smart Escrow uses the token specified in `Escrow::trustline`, which contains both the token address and its number of decimals.

The attribute `decimals: u32` of type `Trustline` is exclusively used in the public Smart Escrow function `get_multiple_escrow_balances` that returns the balance and decimals of multiple Smart Escrow specified in the function call.

The decimals that are returned can hold an arbitrary value specified during initialization of the Smart Escrow that might not match the actual decimals value of the respective token used.

## Recommendation
We recommend that the Smart Escrow fetch the `decimals` attribute at runtime instead by calling `TokenClient::decimals`.

### validate_release_conditions returns wrong error when checking whether funds were already released

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The function `validate_release_conditions` checks whether the funds were already released and in that case returns an error. However, the function incorrectly returns an error indicating that the Smart Escrow was already resolved, rather than specifying that the funds were already released. See `validators/escrow.rs:13-15`:

```rust
if escrow.flags.released {
    return Err(ContractError::EscrowAlreadyResolved);
}
```

## Recommendation
We recommend to create a new error in `ContractError` that indicates that the Smart Escrow was already released and use that error instead.

### validate_release_conditions does not check whether the Smart Escrow has already been resolved

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The function `validate_release_conditions` does not check whether the Smart Escrow has already been resolved. Though, as observed in [B04] validate_release_conditions returns wrong error when checking whether funds were already released, the error `ContractError::EscrowAlreadyResolved` is falsely returned instead of a new error that properly indicates that the Smart Escrow has already been released.

At the same time, this error indicates that the intent was to also check that the Smart Escrow has not already been resolved yet with `resolve_dispute`.

## Recommendation
We recommend adding a missing check in `validate_release_conditions` that the Smart Escrow has already been resolved.

### dispute_resolver should consent to Smart Escrow prior to funding the escrow

Severity: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Design  
Status: Not addressed by client

Currently, a Smart Escrow can be initialized and used right away with arbitrary role allocations, including the `dispute_resolver` that is typically managed by the platform. This means that the initializing party can choose an arbitrary platform fee and specify the `dispute_resolver` address.

In case of a dispute, including scenarios where leftover assets need to be returned, the `dispute_resolver` must act; otherwise, the funds are locked in the Smart Escrow. If the `dispute_resolver` does act, the arbitrarily specified platform fees are enforced.

## Recommendation
To avoid such a deadlock situation, the `dispute_resolver` could be required to explicitly consent to a given Smart Escrow after initialization or Smart Escrow updates through `update_escrow`. This can be done with a new Smart Escrow public function `EscrowContract::consent(e: Env, dispute_resolver: Address, escrow_properties: Escrow)`. At the same time, `fund_escrow` must fail, in case the Smart Escrow has not been consented to by the `dispute_resolver`.

## Status
The client has acknowledged this finding.


### Smart Escrows Are Deployers Despite Having Constructors

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Not addressed by client

The Smart Escrow, which also has a constructor, has the capabilities of deploying and initializing other contracts through its `deploy` endpoint, making it a deployer. The primary purpose of deployer contracts on Soroban was to serve as a workaround for the initial absence of constructors. They were used to deploy and initialize a contract atomically, mitigating the risk of front-running attacks. Since Soroban now natively supports constructors via the `__constructor` function, a separate deployer contract is no longer necessary to perform this initialization.

The coexistence of both a deployer function and a constructor creates redundancy and is an inefficient design pattern. The current constructor is underutilized, as it only sets an `admin` address in storage that is never referenced in subsequent logic. This design choice is problematic because it introduces complexity without providing any functional benefit. It would be more secure and efficient to remove the deployer logic and use the constructor to handle all necessary initialization tasks. This would streamline the contract's deployment process and reduce its attack surface.

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, we recommend either of the following two solutions. The first is to completely remove the constructor and refactor the deployer function to handle all contract initialization. The second, and more robust, solution is to remove the unnecessary deployer functionality and adapt the existing constructor to perform all essential setup tasks.

### Disputed Funds Don't Go Back to Funders

Severity: Medium  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Design  
Status: Not addressed by client

The Smart Escrow contract, which can be used for crowdsourcing, has a limitation in its dispute resolution mechanism. While the contract facilitates multi-party funding for a Service Provider's project milestones, its logic for handling disputes does not consider the possible multiplicity of funders. When a dispute is triggered and resolved, the funds are returned to the `Approver`, rather than being refunded to the original funders. This creates an immediate risk for project backers, as they could lose their investment if a project fails and a dispute occurs, unless the `Approver` can keep track of funders.

Although it may be the case in some scenarios, the `Approver` is not the source of the funds and, as such, should not be the recipient of a refund. This exposes the funders to a potential loss of capital, as they are entirely reliant on the `Approver`'s integrity and willingness to manually return the funds. The contract's current logic does not guarantee the repayment of funds to the rightful owners, leaving funders dependent on trust in what is intended to be a trustless environment.

## Recommendation
To rectify this, the Smart Escrow contract's dispute resolution logic must be updated. The Smart Escrow and platform must either:
1. Store the funders' addresses in persistent data, in pairs with their supplied amounts, implementing an endpoint to allow funders to retrieve their supplied amounts in case of a dispute, or;
2. Keep track of all funders in off-chain storage and find a way to ensure that the `approver` will repay all funders with their due amounts. This approach, although feasible, requires an extra layer of off-chain trust.

### The Trustless Work Platform Does Not Handle Storage Archival

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Not addressed by client

When a Soroban smart contract is deployed on the Stellar network, its ledger entries, which contain the contract's code and data, are given a Time to Live (TTL). This TTL is a specific number of ledgers, and if it's not extended, the ledger entries will eventually expire and be moved to an archive. This archival process is a core feature of Stellar's state management, designed to keep the network's active ledger size manageable and performant by removing dormant data. When a contract's ledger entries are archived, the contract becomes inaccessible for invocations until restored. This means any funds or tokens held within it become inaccessible until the contract is restored from the archive. This process is a key distinction from traditional blockchains, where a contract's state is perpetually part of the active chain.

To prevent a contract from being archived, developers must actively manage its TTL. This is typically done by submitting transactions that extend the contract's ledger entry TTL. A common practice is to call a function on the contract that performs a state read or write, as any access to a contract's storage automatically resets its TTL. For contracts that are not frequently used, a dedicated "ping" or "keep-alive" function can be called at regular intervals to ensure the contract's storage remains active. If a contract has already been archived, it can be brought back by submitting a special transaction called a restore footprint (`RestoreFootprintOp` transaction). This transaction informs the network that the contract's data is needed again, and the Stellar network will bring the latest archived ledger entries back into the active state. This feature ensures that even if a contract expires, its state is not lost forever and can be recovered when needed.

Smart Escrows have no means of updating their own TTL according to the implemented business logic, and no `RestoreFootprintOp` is constructed in the platform's backend.

## Recommendation
To avoid needing to manually reinstate the Smart Escrow data after properly modifying the storage entries from persistent to instance, we recommend extending the time-to-live of the contract data within the contract itself whenever the contract is interacted with. For example, whenever fetching information from Smart Escrows using the `get_escrow` endpoint, extend the contract instance storage TTL.

Additionally, the backend should be able to construct `RestoreFootprintOp` operations to bring back contracts from archival.

The client has acknowledged this finding.


### The Milestone Updates Phase Can Be Skipped

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

According to Trustless Work's documentation, the expected lifecycle of an escrow is composed of 5 stages:
1. Initiation Phase: The foundation of the process, where roles, responsibilities, and transaction terms are established, and the escrow contract is created.
2. Funding Phase: The phase where the funds are deposited into the escrow contract, securing the transaction and preparing for the next steps.
3. Milestone Updates Phase: As the transaction progresses, milestones are marked as completed by the designated party, providing visibility and enabling reviews.
4. Approval Phase: The phase where milestones are reviewed and approved (or disputed), moving the transaction closer to resolution.
5. Release Phase: Funds are released to the designated recipient based on milestone approvals or dispute resolutions, completing the financial component of the transaction.

Although designed to follow this lifecycle, there are no validations in the code enforcing that the Milestone Updates Phase is necessary. Milestones can be approved regardless of whether their status is updated or not.

## Recommendation
Either recognize the Milestone Updates Phase as optional or enforce its necessity in the contract's business logic.

### It Is Possible To Change The Platform Address Of A Smart Esrow

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `platform` address, as previously discussed in the Platform Features and Logic Description, is the authority representing the platform or entity responsible for the mediation of the agreement between the `service_provider` and, primarily, funders. Due to its role, the `platform` address is the only address capable of modifying the properties of a deployed smart escrow, subject to a specific set of validations.

The validations implemented when attempting to update a smart escrow do not consider the possibility of the `platform` address itself being modified. This may introduce trust issues related to the platform entity and strongly suggests that users should manually check the state of a smart escrow prior to performing operations on it.

This issue is informational because smart escrows cannot be updated after being funded, which narrows the window in which this property could be exploited.

## Recommendation
Make the `platform` address immutable by enforcing immutability at the contract level.

### Differences Between the Single and Multi-Release Escrows

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

While reviewing the code of the Multi-Release Smart Escrow version, multiple minor differences between the implementations have been found in sections that implement the same logic. These differences may hinder the maintainability of both versions of the contracts.

One of these differences, however, is more significant. When resolving a milestone dispute in the Multi-Release version, one of the parameters is named `service_provider_funds`, with its naming indicating that it holds the amount of funds to be sent to the `service_provider`. However, tracing the logic shows that these funds are actually sent to the `receiver` instead. In the Single-Release version, this variable is appropriately named `release_funds`.

## Recommendation
Align the implementations of shared logic across both contract versions to improve maintainability and reduce confusion.

## Backend Findings (TSxx)

### In-Memory Queue Storage Causing Data Loss and Scaling Issues

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `PendingWriteQueueService` uses an in-memory `Map<string, PendingWriteItem>()` for transaction queue storage, which introduces multiple critical issues:
1. Data Loss on Server Restart/Crash: All pending transactions are lost when the server restarts, leading to incomplete blockchain operations that cannot be recovered. Users may experience failed transactions with inconsistent state.
2. No Horizontal Scaling Support: Each server instance has an isolated queue, so load balancer routing to different instances breaks transaction flow. A transaction started on Server A will fail if the completion request hits Server B.
3. Memory Leak Risk: Abandoned transactions are never removed from the queue. There's no TTL (Time To Live) mechanism for stale entries, which may cause the queue to grow indefinitely without cleanup.
4. No Observability: Cannot monitor queue size or processing metrics, no visibility into failed transactions across restarts, making it difficult to debug transaction issues.

## Recommendation
Replace the in-memory storage with a persistent, distributed solution:

```ts
// Option 1: Redis-based queue
import { Queue } from "bull";

const pendingWriteQueue = new Queue("pending writes", {
  redis: { host: "redis-server", port: 6379 },
});

// Option 2: External message queue (AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, etc.)
```

Implement proper cleanup mechanisms and monitoring for queue health.

### Open CORS Policy Allowing Unauthorized Cross-Origin Requests

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `main.ts` file has an overly permissive CORS configuration that allows requests from any origin:

```ts
app.enableCors({
  origin: true, // Allows ANY origin
  methods: "GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE",
  credentials: true, // Dangerous with origin: true
});
```

This configuration creates several security vulnerabilities:
1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Any website can make authenticated requests to the API
2. Data Theft: Malicious sites can access user data through browser requests
3. API Abuse: Unauthorized third parties can consume API resources without restriction

## Recommendation
Restrict CORS to specific, trusted domains:

```ts
app.enableCors({
  origin: ["https://yourdomain.com", "https://app.yourdomain.com"],
  methods: "GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE",
  credentials: true,
});
```

Use environment variables to manage different origins for different environments (development, staging, production).

### Missing Authentication Guards on Critical Endpoints

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

Multiple critical endpoints lack proper authentication guards, making them publicly accessible:
1. User Endpoints: All `/user/*` API endpoints don't require authentication. Users can:
   - Get all users data via `GET /user/get-all`, including sensitive `apiKey` information
   - Update any user's data as long as they have the user's ID
   - Access user profiles without authorization

2. Notification Endpoints: `notifications.controller.ts` endpoints lack authentication guards, allowing:
   - Unauthorized access to notification data
   - Public access to sensitive notification information
   - Uncontrolled access to notification operations

This creates severe security vulnerabilities, as sensitive user data and system operations are exposed to unauthorized users.

## Recommendation
Add authentication guards to all protected endpoints:

```ts
@UseGuards(AuthGuard())
@ApiBearerAuth("jwt-auth")
```

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types and operations. Ensure that users can only access and modify their own data unless they have explicit administrative privileges.

### Authorization Bypass in Escrow Repository

Severity: Medium  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `escrow.repository.ts` file contains a critical authorization bypass vulnerability in the `findByAdvancedQuery` method. When both `signer` and `contractIds` parameters are provided, the method only validates against `contractIds` but ignores the `signer` validation:

```ts
} else if (contractIds && signer) {
  query = this.col.where("contractId", "in", contractIds);
  // Missing signer validation - allows access to any contract regardless of signer
}
```

This allows users to access escrow contracts they shouldn't have access to by providing any valid contract IDs, bypassing the signer-based authorization mechanism.

Security Impact:
- Authorization Bypass: Users can access escrows they don't own or have rights to
- Data Exposure: Contract data becomes accessible without proper authorization
- Privilege Escalation: Users can potentially view or interact with high-value escrows

## Recommendation
Add proper signer validation to the query:

```ts
} else if (contractIds && signer) {
  query = this.col
    .where("contractId", "in", contractIds)
    .where("signer", "==", signer);
}
```

Implement comprehensive authorization checks throughout the escrow repository to ensure users can only access contracts they are authorized to view or modify.

### Information Disclosure Through Error Messages

Severity: Low  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `user.repository.ts` file exposes internal system information through detailed error messages:

```ts
throw new NotFoundException(`User ${id} not found`);
throw new ConflictException(
  `User with address ${data.address} already exists`,
);
```

These detailed error messages introduce multiple security vulnerabilities:
1. User Enumeration: Attackers can systematically discover valid user IDs by analyzing different error responses
2. System Information Leak: Internal identifiers and data structures are exposed to potential attackers
3. Attack Vector Discovery: Detailed errors help attackers infer the system architecture and identify potential attack vectors

This information can be used by malicious actors to map out the user base and system structure, facilitating more targeted attacks.

## Recommendation
Use generic error messages for client responses while logging detailed information separately for debugging:

```ts
// Generic response to client
throw new NotFoundException('User not found');

// Detailed logging for debugging (server-side only)
this.logger.warn(`User lookup failed: User ${id} not found`);
```

Implement a consistent error handling strategy that:
- Returns generic, non-revealing error messages to clients
- Logs detailed information server-side for debugging
- Avoid exposing internal system details, including whether a specific user exists.

### HTTP Connections Allowed in Production Environment

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

Multiple locations in the codebase allow HTTP connections to Stellar RPC servers by using `{ allowHttp: true }`. This configuration permits unencrypted communication with blockchain nodes, which poses significant security risks in production environments.

Security Risks:
1. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: HTTP traffic can be intercepted and potentially modified by attackers
2. Data Exposure: Sensitive blockchain transaction data is transmitted in plain text
3. Transaction Tampering: Unencrypted communication channels can be exploited to manipulate transaction data

This is particularly concerning for a financial application handling escrow transactions, where data integrity and confidentiality are critical.

## Recommendation
Configure the application to use HTTPS-only connections in production:

```ts
// Use environment-specific configuration
const rpcConfig = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? { /* HTTPS only - remove allowHttp */ }
  : { allowHttp: true }; // Only allow HTTP in development

// Or explicitly enforce HTTPS
const rpcConfig = {
   allowHttp: false // Force HTTPS connections
};
```

Implement environment-specific configurations that:
- Force HTTPS connections in production and staging environments
- Allow HTTP only in local development environments
- Add runtime checks to prevent accidental HTTP usage in production

### Unsafe HTTP Methods for State-Changing Operations

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `notifications.controller.ts` uses GET HTTP methods for operations that change system state. This violates REST principles and creates security vulnerabilities:

```ts
// Using GET for state-changing operations (incorrect)
@Get('/endpoint-that-changes-state')
someStateChangingOperation() {
  // Modifies system state
}
```

Security and Design Issues:
1. HTTP Semantics Violation: GET requests should be idempotent and safe (no side effects)
2. CSRF Vulnerability: State changes via GET can be exploited through Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
3. Unintended Side Effects: GET requests can be cached, prefetched, or triggered by web crawlers, causing unintended state changes
4. Security Tool Confusion: Security scanners and firewalls may not properly analyze GET requests for malicious state changes

CSRF Vulnerability:
Websites can use safe requests such as GET to load static resources for websites such as images, e.g.: `<img src="https://www.somewebsite.com/some-image.jpg">`. This can be exploited to make clients of such websites send malicious GET requests to other websites. Cookies that are marked as `SameSite=None` are always sent alongside these requests. Cookies that are marked as `SameSite=Lax` are only added to safe requests such as GET. In case the cookies are to be utilized by the backend, this could be a source of potential security vulnerabilities, as cookies are typically marked as `SameSite=Lax`.

## Recommendation
Change GET methods to appropriate HTTP methods for state-changing operations:

```ts
// Use POST for operations that create or modify state
@Post('/endpoint-that-changes-state')
someStateChangingOperation() {
  // Modifies system state
}

// Use PUT for idempotent updates
@Put('/resource/:id')
updateResource() {
  // Updates existing resource
}

// Use DELETE for deletion operations
@Delete('/resource/:id')
deleteResource() {
  // Removes resource
}
```

Follow REST conventions:
- GET: Retrieve data (read-only, idempotent)
- POST: Create new resources or non-idempotent operations
- PUT: Update existing resources (idempotent)
- DELETE: Remove resources

This finding has been addressed in commit ID [`27c7ebe`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/27c7ebe).


### Type Safety Issues - From 'any' Types to DocumentData Casting

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The codebase previously made extensive use of the `any` type throughout multiple files, which compromised TypeScript's type safety benefits. This originally affected:

Repository Layer:
- `user.repository.ts`: Functions like `getAllUsers`, `findById`, `create`, `addApiKey`, `update`, `updateAddress` returned `Promise<any>`
- `escrow.repository.ts`: Variables like `const raw = doc.data() as any` bypassed type checking
- `escrow-firestore.service.ts`: Parameters like `escrowProperties: any` and return types with `data?: any`

Utility Functions:
- `firebase.utils.ts`: Type annotations like `error: any` in try/catch blocks
- `parse.utils.ts`: Multiple functions used `any` for parameters and return types
- `stellar-transaction-builder.service.ts`: Various `any` types throughout

Progress Made:
The explicit `any` types have been largely removed from the codebase, which is a significant improvement.

Remaining Issue:
While the code now uses `admin.firestore.DocumentData` (which is better than `any`), it still lacks specific type annotation:

```ts
const escrow = doc.data(); // Type: FirebaseFirestore.DocumentData
```

Areas Needing Specific Type Casting:
- `escrow.repository.ts`: Variables like `const raw = snap.data()!` and `const raw = doc.data()` use generic `DocumentData`
- `notifications.service.ts`: `const escrow = escrowDoc.data()`, `const escrow = doc.data()` in multiple functions lack proper type annotations
- `user.repository.ts`: Document data retrieval functions return generic `DocumentData` instead of `User` types
- `escrow-firestore.service.ts`: Firestore operations use generic types instead of specific escrow interfaces

Type Safety Impact:
- Loss of IntelliSense and autocomplete for specific document properties
- No compile-time checking for property access
- Potential runtime errors when accessing properties that may not exist
- Reduced code maintainability and documentation value

## Recommendation
Cast `DocumentData` to specific types that match the actual document structure:

```ts
// Instead of:
const escrow = doc.data(); // Type: DocumentData

// Use specific casting:
const escrow = doc.data() as FirestoreEscrowDocument;
// or
const escrow = doc.data() as SingleReleaseEscrow;

// For notifications service:
const escrow = escrowDoc.data() as FirestoreEscrowDocument;

// For user repository:
const userData = doc.data() as FirestoreUserDocument;

// Create specific Firestore document interfaces:
interface FirestoreEscrowDocument {
  contractId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  amount?: number;
  status: string;
  createdAt: FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp;
  updatedAt: FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp;
  // ... other escrow properties
}

interface FirestoreUserDocument {
  address: string;
  email?: string;
  name?: string;
  apiKey?: string;
  createdAt: FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp;
  // ... other user properties
}
```

Benefits of Specific Type Casting:
- Full IntelliSense and autocomplete support
- Compile-time property validation
- Better code documentation
- Reduced runtime errors

### Incorrect Validation Decorators for Numeric Fields

Severity: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `single-release-escrow.class.ts` file contains incorrect validation decorators where numeric fields are decorated with `@IsString()` instead of the appropriate `@IsNumber()` decorator:

```ts
// Incorrect validation
@IsString()
amount: number;

@IsString()
approverFunds: number;

@IsString()
receiverFunds: number;

@IsString()
platformFee: number;
```

This mismatch between the validation decorators and the actual data types creates several issues:
1. Runtime Validation Failures: String validation will fail when receiving valid numeric inputs
2. Type Safety Compromise: The type system expects numbers but validation expects strings
3. API Contract Confusion: Unclear whether the API expects strings or numbers
4. Potential Data Corruption: Inconsistent type handling can lead to incorrect data processing

## Recommendation
Use the correct validation decorators that match the TypeScript types:

```ts
// Correct validation
@IsNumber()
amount: number;

@IsNumber()
approverFunds: number;

@IsNumber()
receiverFunds: number;

@IsNumber()
platformFee: number;
```

Additionally, consider adding more specific numeric validations:

```ts
@IsNumber()
@IsPositive() // Ensure positive values for amounts
@Min(0.01) // Minimum transaction amount
amount: number;
```

Review all DTO classes to ensure validation decorators match their corresponding TypeScript types.

### Client-Side Timestamps Creating Data Inconsistency

Severity: Low  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

Multiple files throughout the codebase use client-side timestamps (`new Date()`) instead of server-side timestamps for Firestore operations. This creates several critical issues:

Problems with Client-Side Timestamps:
1. Timezone Issues: Clients in different timezones generate inconsistent timestamps
2. Clock Drift: Client system clocks may be inaccurate or out of sync
3. Non-Atomic Operations: Client timestamps don't reflect the actual database write time
4. Security Risk: Clients can manipulate timestamps maliciously

Affected Files:
- `repositories/escrow.repository.ts`: Uses `new Date()` for `updatedAt` and `createdAt`
- `stellar-contract/escrow/firestore-services/escrow-firestore.service.ts`: Uses `new Date()` for `updatedAt`
- `stellar-contract/queue/pending-write-handler.service.ts`: Uses `new Date()` for `updatedAt`
- `firebase/converters/escrow.repository.ts`: Uses `new Date()` as fallback values

Current Problem:

```ts
// Inconsistent client-side timestamps
isActive: true,
updatedAt: new Date(),
createdAt: new Date(),
```

## Recommendation
Replace client-side timestamps with `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`:

```ts
import { FieldValue } from 'firebase-admin/firestore';

// Use server timestamps for consistency
isActive: true,
updatedAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
createdAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
```

Benefits of server timestamps:
- Consistent timezone (server timezone)
- Accurate timing (actual database write time)
- Atomic operations (timestamp is set when the write occurs)
- Security (clients cannot manipulate timestamps)
- Proper ordering of operations

Also update milestone timestamps (`approvedAt`, `completedAt`) for consistency.

### Missing Input Validation and Type Annotations

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

Several functions throughout the codebase lack proper input validation and explicit type annotations, creating potential runtime errors and security vulnerabilities:

Missing Type Annotations:
1. `parse.utils.ts`: The `adjustPricesToMicroUSDC` function has missing type annotation for the `decimals` parameter:

```ts
export function adjustPricesToMicroUSDC(price: number, decimals): string {
```

2. `firebase/converters/escrow.repository.ts`: Converter functions lack explicit parameter types:

```ts
toFirestore: (data) => ({
fromFirestore: (snap: QueryDocumentSnapshot) =>
```

Missing Input Validation:
Functions accept parameters without validating them:
- Finite number checks
- Range validation
- Non-negative number validation
- Null/undefined checks

Security and Reliability Risks:
1. Runtime Errors: Invalid inputs can cause unexpected crashes
2. Data Corruption: Unvalidated inputs can corrupt calculations
3. Security Vulnerabilities: Malicious inputs might exploit undefined behavior

## Recommendation
Add explicit type annotations and comprehensive input validation:

```ts
// Add proper typing and validation
export function adjustPricesToMicroUSDC(price: number, decimals: number): string {
  if (!Number.isFinite(price) || price < 0) {
    throw new Error('Price must be a finite, non-negative number');
  }
  if (!Number.isFinite(decimals) || decimals <= 0) {
    throw new Error('Decimals must be a positive, finite number');
  }
  // ... rest of function
}

// Fix converter type annotations
toFirestore: (data: FirestoreSingleReleaseEscrow) => ({
fromFirestore: (snap: QueryDocumentSnapshot) =>
```

Implement consistent validation patterns:
- Type guards for complex objects
- Range validation for numeric inputs
- Format validation for strings
- Null/undefined checks where appropriate

### Unreliable Type Guard Functions and Interface Design Issues

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

**Unreliable Type Guards**

The `isRawSingleEscrow()` and `isRawMultiEscrow()` functions use property presence (`"amount" in data`) as discriminants instead of the explicit type field. This approach is fragile and may lead to incorrect type narrowing:

```ts
// Current fragile approach
export function isRawSingleEscrow(data: RawEscrowData): data is RawSingleEscrow {
  return "amount" in data; // Fragile - relies on property presence
}
```

**Interface Inconsistencies:**

Different flag naming conventions between single and multi-release escrows create confusion:

```ts
interface RawSingleFlags {
  dispute: boolean;    // Different naming
  release: boolean;    // Different naming
  resolved: boolean;
}

interface RawMultiFlags {
  disputed: boolean; // Different naming
  released: boolean; // Different naming
  resolved: boolean;
  approved: boolean;
}
```

**Missing Interface Consolidation:**

`RawSingleEscrow` and `RawMultiEscrow` share common properties but don't extend a base interface, leading to code duplication.

## Recommendation
Fix Type Guards to Use Discriminant Field:

```ts
export function isRawSingleEscrow(data: RawEscrowData): data is RawSingleEscrow {
  return data.type === "single-release";
}

export function isRawMultiEscrow(data: RawEscrowData): data is RawMultiEscrow {
  return data.type === "multi-release";
}
```

Standardize Flag Naming:
Choose consistent naming convention (either past tense or present tense) for all flag interfaces.

Create Base Interface:

```ts
export interface RawEscrow {
  title: string;
  roles: RawRoles;
  description: string;
  engagement_id: string;
  platform_fee: string | number | bigint;
  trustline: RawTrustline;
  receiver_memo: string | number | bigint;
}

export interface RawSingleEscrow extends RawEscrow {
  type: "single-release";
  amount: string | number | bigint;
  flags: RawSingleFlags;
  milestones: RawSingleMilestone[];
}
```

### Environment Configuration Management Issues

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Document Prominently  
Status: Addressed by client

**Environment Variable Inconsistencies:**

The `.env.example` file contains inconsistencies with actual code usage:

1. Firebase Configuration Mismatch:
   - `.env.example` uses: `FIREBASE_PROD_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_PROD_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PROD_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Actual code uses: `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_MAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`

2. Unused Environment Variables:
   - `ISSUER_ADDRESS`, `USDC_SOROBAN_CIRCLE_TOKEN_TEST`, `API_SECRET_KEY_WALLET`, `API_PUBLIC_KEY_WALLET` are defined but not used

3. Environment Value Mismatch:
   - `.env.example` defines `ENVIRONMENT=LOCAL` but code only uses `DEV` and `PROD`

**Configuration Management Issues:**

1. Direct Environment Variable Usage: Code directly accesses `process.env` instead of using NestJS `@nestjs/config` for type safety

## Recommendation
Fix Environment Configuration:

```ts
// Update .env.example to match actual usage
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_CLIENT_MAIL=
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=
ENVIRONMENT=DEV
```

Use Typed Configuration:

```ts
// Instead of process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {}
const projectId = this.configService.get<string>('FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID');
```

Clean Up Unused Environment Variables:
Remove unused variables from `.env.example` or implement their usage in the codebase if they are intended for future features.

### Code Quality and Documentation Issues

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

**Missing API Documentation:**

Multiple DTOs lack proper Swagger documentation, making the API difficult to understand and use:
- `LoginUserDto`, `FundWithMemoDto`, `UpdateUserDto` missing `@ApiProperty` decorators
- `notifications/test` controller lacks `@ApiTag("Notifications")`
- Internal endpoints not excluded from Swagger docs

**Missing Field Validation:**

DTOs lack proper validation decorators for critical fields:
- `CreateUserDto.address` should use `@IsAddressValid()` validator for Stellar address format validation
- `LoginUserDto.wallet` field lacks wallet address validation
- Email fields should use `@IsEmail()` for proper email format validation

**Unused Code and Files:**

- `src/repositories/index.ts` - empty file
- `src/firebase/converters/index.ts` - empty file
- `src/common/dto/escrow-payload.dto.ts` - `EscrowPayloadDto` interface unused
- `exceptions/engagement-id.exception.ts` - `EngagementIdException` never used
- Entire auth directory may be obsolete

**Inconsistent Naming Conventions:**

- Folder naming: `src/stellar-contract/deployer/Dto` vs `dto` elsewhere
- Variable naming: `milestone_index` should be `milestoneIndex` (camelCase)
- Collection names hardcoded throughout instead of using enums

**Logging and Error Handling:**

- `console.log` used instead of NestJS `Logger` throughout the codebase
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing structured logging for debugging and monitoring

**Code Structure Issues:**

- Redundant code: `.then((escrow) => escrow)` in `helper.service.ts`
- Type coercion: Using `==` instead of `===` in comparisons
- Repository bypass: `EscrowFirestoreService.saveEscrow()` bypasses repository pattern

**Duplicated code:**

- `helper.service.ts:631:handlePendingWrite` and `indexer.service.ts:23:updateFromTxHash` implement the same functionality
  - `handlePendingWrite` takes two arguments instead of one, but both arguments are expected to always be equal

**Wrong logging and error messages:**

The codebase contains wrong logging and error messages, most likely due to copy and paste of program code:
- `src/utils/firebase.utils.ts:202:createNotification`: Error fetching trustline

**Validation pipe handling:**

- `src/main.ts:17` defines a global `ValidationPipe` to be used for all endpoints, while some endpoints define an additional similar `ValidationPipe`, such as the endpoints in `src/users/user.controller.ts`

**Explicit configuration values:**

- `@UseGuards(AuthGuard())`: This should reference the respective authentication guard that is supposed to be used explicitly, in case additional authentication guards are added to the backend
  - e.g.: `@UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt'))` or `@UseGuards(AuthGuard('local'))`

**Inconsistent database schema:**

- `src/stellar-contract/queue/pending-write-handler.service.ts:42` writes `approvedAt` for single-release milestones, but not for multi-release milestones

**Improper variable names:**

`src/stellar-contract/queue/pending-write-handler.service.ts:100` defines the variable `completedAt` that should instead be called `lastUpdatedAt` or similar - this variable is updated everytime the status is updated instead of only when the status is complete

## Recommendation
Improve API Documentation:

```ts
@ApiProperty({
   description: 'User wallet address',
   example: 'GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
})
wallet: string;

@ApiTag("Notifications")
@Controller('notifications')
```

Add Proper Field Validation:

```ts
// Use existing custom validators for address validation
@IsAddressValid()
@IsNotEmpty()
address: string;

// Add email validation
@IsOptional()
@IsEmail()
email?: string;

// Apply wallet validation consistently
@IsAddressValid()
@IsNotEmpty()
wallet: string;
```

Clean Up Unused Code:
- Remove empty files and unused interfaces
- Consolidate or remove obsolete auth directory
- Remove redundant code patterns
- Reduce duplicated code

Standardize Naming:

```ts
// Use enums for collection names
enum Collections {
  ESCROWS = 'escrows',
  USERS = 'users',
  CONTRACT_TEMPLATES = 'contract-templates'
}

// Use camelCase for variables
milestoneIndex
// instead of
milestone_index
```

Implement Structured Logging:

```ts
// Replace console.log with NestJS Logger
private readonly logger = new Logger(ServiceName.name);
this.logger.log('Operation completed successfully');
```

Use Strict Equality:

```ts
// Replace == with ===
if (tag === "u64")
// instead of
if (tag == "u64")
```

### Data Architecture and Repository Pattern Issues

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

**Repository Pattern Bypass:**

The `EscrowFirestoreService.saveEscrow()` method bypasses the repository layer and calls `addEscrow()` directly, ignoring carefully designed type conversions:

```ts
// Current: Bypasses repository pattern
await this.firestoreService.addEscrow(docId, escrowProperties);

// Should use: Repository methods for proper type conversion
if (escrowProperties.type === "single-release") {
  await this.escrowRepository.saveSingle(escrowProperties as SingleReleaseEscrow);
}
```

This bypass means that `escrowRepo.saveSingle()` and `mapToFirestoreSingle()` methods are never called during escrow deployment, causing data inconsistency and ignoring proper type conversions.

**All database queries should be defined in FirebaseService**

The Firebase service provides the method `getFirestore()` that returns the Firestore instance that can be used to query the database. This leads to query definitions throughout the codebase, instead of having all queries collectively declared in the `FirebaseService`.

**Hardcoded Collection Names:**

Collection names are hardcoded throughout the codebase instead of using centralized constants:
- `notifications.service.ts`: `"escrows"`
- `escrow.repository.ts`: `"escrows"`
- `user.repository.ts`: `"users"`
- `contract-templates.service.ts`: `"contract-templates"`

**Hardcoded values:**

Numerical values are hardcoded as values in the code instead of using constant variables:
- `src/utils/parse.utils.ts:25`: `BigInt(Math.round(price * 1e7))`

**Type Safety Issues in Firestore:**

- Using `admin.firestore.DocumentData` instead of specific types
- `const escrow = doc.data()` lacks proper type annotation
- Loose type definitions that don't match actual usage patterns

**Interface Design Questions:**

Whether Firestore interfaces should use flat structures (`Record<string, string>`) for easier queries or typed objects (`Roles`, `Trustline`) for better type safety.

**NestJS modules:**

- `src/config/firebase.config.ts` is not a module, but should be due to providing functions and usage of services

## Recommendation
Fix Repository Pattern:

```ts
// Update EscrowFirestoreService.saveEscrow() to use repository
// Note: Consider adding validation before casting for better type safety
if (escrowProperties.type === "single-release") {
  await this.escrowRepository.saveSingle(
     escrowProperties as SingleReleaseEscrow,
  );
} else {
  await this.escrowRepository.saveMulti(
     escrowProperties as MultiReleaseEscrow,
  );
}
```

Define all database queries in FirebaseService. Move all database queries to `FirebaseService` and remove the method `getFirestore` to disincentivize creating queries outside of `FirebaseService`.

Centralize Collection Names:

```ts
enum Collections {
  ESCROWS = 'escrows',
  USERS = 'users',
  CONTRACT_TEMPLATES = 'contract-templates',
  NOTIFICATIONS = 'notifications'
}

// Usage
this.col = this.firestore.collection(Collections.ESCROWS);
```

Centralize constant magic values:
Create proper constant variables with names and potentially documentation that describe the respective value instead of using undocumented magic values directly in program code.

Improve Type Safety:

```ts
// Use specific types instead of DocumentData
const escrow = doc.data() as FirestoreEscrowDocument;
```

Standardize Interface Design:
Keep current flat structure for Firestore queries but improve conversion logic between flat and typed structures.

Usage of NestJS modules:
Use NestJS modules and services when proper.

### Development Tooling and Code Quality Setup

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The codebase previously lacked proper development tooling and code quality enforcement mechanisms:

**Original Issues:**

1. Missing ESLint Configuration: No ESLint setup for TypeScript code quality enforcement
2. No Pre-commit Hooks: No automated code quality checks before commits
3. Outdated Husky Version: Need for modern pre-commit hook management
4. Missing Linting Integration: No integration between ESLint and development workflow

**Impact of Missing Tooling:**

- Inconsistent code formatting and style
- Type safety issues not caught during development
- Manual code review burden increased
- Potential for committing problematic code

## Recommendation
Implement comprehensive development tooling, including:
- ESLint with TypeScript support
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Prettier for code formatting
- Lint-staged for efficient pre-commit processing

Required Setup:

```bash
### Install ESLint and related packages
npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint

### Install Husky for git hooks
npm install --save-dev husky

### Install Prettier and integration
npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier

### Install lint-staged for efficient pre-commit processing
npm install --save-dev lint-staged

### Backend allows for submitting any pre-signed transaction to the Stellar blockchain

Severity: Low  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The function `sendTransaction` at `src/stellar-contract/helper/helper.service.ts:74` takes a signed transaction and sends the transaction to the Stellar blockchain. However, the intended flow is that only transactions originally generated by the backend, signed by the end-user on the client side, and then returned to the backend should be submitted.

However, `sendTransaction` submits a transaction before verifying whether the respective transaction has been created by the backend, i.e., checked whether the transaction hash is in the `pendingWriteQueue`. As a result, the backend can be abused to send arbitrary transactions to the blockchain.

```ts
const response = await this.horizonServer.submitTransaction(transaction);

const pending = this.pendingWriteQueue.get(txHash);
if (!pending) {
  throw new HttpException(
     {
        status: HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST,
        message: `No pending write for tx ${txHash}`,
     },
     HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST,
  );
}
```

## Recommendation
Check whether the transaction hash is in the `pendingWriteQueue` before submitting the transaction to the blockchain. In case the hash is not in the queue, abort and do not submit the transaction.

### Singleton State Sharing in Transaction Builder

Severity: Medium  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `StellarTransactionBuilderService` is registered as a singleton in NestJS but maintains mutable instance state, resulting in critical race conditions when multiple requests access the service at the same time. This design flaw can lead to transactions being built with incorrect parameters, potentially causing financial losses in the escrow system.

The service is registered as a singleton in `stellar.module.ts` but maintains shared mutable state across all requests:

```ts
@Injectable()
export class StellarTransactionBuilderService {
  private signer!: string;             // Shared across all requests - User identity
  private contractId!: string;         // Shared across all requests - Contract address
  private wasmHash?: string;           // Shared across all requests - WASM deployment hash
  private method!: string;             // Shared across all requests - Smart contract method
  private operationFunc?: string;      // Shared across all requests - Operation function
  private params: xdr.ScVal[] = [];    // Shared across all requests - Method parameters
  private constructorArgs?: xdr.ScVal[]; // Shared across all requests - Constructor args
  private fee: string = "1000";        // Shared across all requests - Transaction fee
  private useHorizon: boolean = false; // Shared across all requests - Server selection
  private addMemo?: string;            // Shared across all requests - Transaction memo
  private queueAction?: { ... };       // Shared across all requests - Queue operations
}
```

Critical race condition scenarios include:

**Scenario 1: Fee Contamination**

```ts
// Request A (SharedEscrowService)
txBuilder.setFee("100").buildUnsignedXDR();

// Request B (SingleReleaseService) - concurrent
txBuilder.setFee("5000").buildUnsignedXDR();

// Request A might use fee "5000" instead of intended "100"
```

**Scenario 2: Contract ID Cross-contamination**

```ts
// Request A sets contractId "CONTRACT_ABC"
await txBuilder.setContractId("CONTRACT_ABC")...

// Request B sets contractId "CONTRACT_XYZ"
await txBuilder.setContractId("CONTRACT_XYZ")...

// Request A continues and might use "CONTRACT_XYZ"
```

**Scenario 3: Queue Action Mix-up**

```ts
// Request A: Fund escrow operation
txBuilder.addToQueue("FUND_ESCROW", "single-release", {...}, queue);

// Request B: Release funds operation
txBuilder.addToQueue("RELEASE_FUNDS", "multi-release", {...}, queue);

// Request A might trigger "RELEASE_FUNDS" action instead
```

Many services (`SharedEscrowService`, `SingleReleaseService`, `MultiReleaseService`, and `DeployerService`) use the same singleton instance, creating potential for parameter contamination between concurrent operations across all transaction-related functionality in the system. The `reset()` method in finally blocks provides insufficient protection as race conditions occur between method calls, not after completion.

**Critical Issue: Incomplete Reset Function**

The `reset()` method fails to reset ALL shared fields, making some race conditions persist even longer:

```ts
reset(): void {
  this.signer = "";
  this.contractId = "";
  this.method = "";
  this.params = [];
  this.useHorizon = false;
  this.addMemo = undefined;
  this.queueAction = undefined;
  this.constructorArgs = [];

  // MISSING - These fields are NEVER reset:
  // this.fee = "1000";           // Fee persists across requests!
  // this.wasmHash = undefined; // WASM hash persists!
  // this.operationFunc = undefined; // Operation func persists!
}
```

This means `fee`, `wasmHash`, and `operationFunc` contamination persists across multiple requests until explicitly overwritten.

This affects all transaction-related operations in the system and can lead to wrong fees, operations on incorrect contracts, or funds released to wrong parties.

## Recommendation
We recommend implementing either a request-scoped service or a stateless factory pattern to eliminate shared mutable state:

**Option A: Request-Scoped Service**

```ts
@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class StellarTransactionBuilderService {
  // Each request gets its own instance
}
```

**Option B: Stateless Factory Pattern (Preferred)**

```ts
@Injectable()
export class StellarTransactionBuilderFactory {
  createBuilder(): StellarTransactionBuilder {
    return new StellarTransactionBuilder(this.sorobanServer, this.horizonServer);
  }
}
```

This ensures each operation gets a fresh, isolated builder instance with no shared state between concurrent requests.

### Insecure private key storage in singleton service instance variables

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The `HelperService` stores sensitive private key material in an instance variable (`sourceKeypair`), which creates security risks in a singleton service architecture. This pattern retains private keys in memory longer than necessary and potentially exposes them across multiple method calls within the same service instance.

```ts
@Injectable()
export class HelperService {
  private sourceKeypair: StellarSDK.Keypair; // Private key stored in instance variable

  async establishTrustline(sourceSecretKey: string): Promise<ApiResponse> {
    try {
      this.sourceKeypair = StellarSDK.Keypair.fromSecret(sourceSecretKey); // Stored in instance
      const account = await this.sorobanServer.getAccount(
         this.sourceKeypair.publicKey(), // Used from instance variable
      );

      // ... rest of method uses this.sourceKeypair
      const result = await signAndSendTransaction(
         transaction,
         this.sourceKeypair, // Private key passed from instance variable
         this.sorobanServer,
         false,
      );
    }
  }
}
```

Security Concerns:
1. Extended Memory Exposure: Private keys remain in memory as instance variables until the service is garbage collected or the key is overwritten
2. Cross-Method Accessibility: Any method in the service can access `this.sourceKeypair` even if not intended
3. Debugging/Logging Risk: Instance variables are more likely to be accidentally exposed in debug output or error logs
4. Memory Dumps: Private keys stored in instance variables are more likely to appear in memory dumps during debugging

Current Risk Level: While the current usage in `establishTrustline()` method appears to use the key only within the same method scope, storing sensitive cryptographic material in instance variables is an anti-pattern that violates the principle of least exposure.

## Recommendation
Limit private key scope to local variables within methods and clear references as soon as they are no longer required:

```ts
async establishTrustline(sourceSecretKey: string): Promise<ApiResponse> {
  try {
    // Use local variable instead of instance variable
    const sourceKeypair = StellarSDK.Keypair.fromSecret(sourceSecretKey);

    const account = await this.sorobanServer.getAccount(
       sourceKeypair.publicKey(),
    );

    const usdcAsset = new StellarSDK.Asset("USDC", this.usdcTokenPublic);
    const operations = [
       StellarSDK.Operation.changeTrust({ asset: usdcAsset }),
    ];
    const transaction = buildTransaction(account, operations);

    const result = await signAndSendTransaction(
       transaction,
       sourceKeypair, // Pass local variable
       this.sorobanServer,
       false,
    );

    // Optional: Explicitly clear sensitive data
    // sourceKeypair = null; // Clear reference when done

    return {
       status: result.status,
       message: "The trust line has been correctly defined in the USDC token",
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling...
  }
}
```

Additional Security Improvements:
1. Remove instance variable: Delete `private sourceKeypair: StellarSDK.Keypair;` from the class
2. Minimize scope: Use local variables for all cryptographic material
3. Clear sensitive data: Explicitly null sensitive variables when operations complete
4. Audit all services: Review other services for similar private key storage patterns

### Inefficient database querying

Severity: Low  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The codebase uses inefficient database queries and filters manually after fetching multiple or all documents of a collection. For example, the following code from `src/notifications/notifications.service.ts:57` applies a Firestore query and then performs additional manual filtering afterwards.

```ts
const snapshot = await firestore
  .collection("escrows")
  .where("disputeFlag", "==", true)
  .get();
const HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD = 500; // ! ask: how many USDC?
for (const doc of snapshot.docs) {
  const escrow = doc.data() as SingleReleaseEscrow;
  if (escrow.amount > HIGH_VALUE_THRESHOLD) {
    // ! ask: amount or balance?
    await createNotification(this.firebaseService, {
      contractId: escrow.contractId,
      type: "high_value_dispute",
      title: "High Value Escrow in Dispute",
      message: `Escrow ${escrow.title} with value ${escrow.amount} is in dispute`,
      entities: [
         escrow.roles.approver,
         escrow.roles.serviceProvider,
         escrow.roles.platformAddress,
         escrow.roles.releaseSigner,
         escrow.roles.disputeResolver,
         escrow.roles.receiver,
      ],
    });
  }
}
```

## Recommendation
We recommend to adjust all queries to include all relevant filters beforehand, as Firestore supports expressive queries.

### Notifications are created every hour once they start getting generated

Severity: Low  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

**Cron jobs:**

The backend uses the `@Cron` annotations from `@nestjs/common` to create functions that are run periodically to create notifications for users. These functions check for criteria such as smart escrow and milestone staleness to remind the users for pending work items.

For example, the function `src/notifications/notifications.service.ts:17:checkPendingEscrows` creates notifications for smart escrows that have unapproved milestones and are older than a fixed offset (for instance, 7 days). This check is executed every hour. By design, this function will continuously generate notifications until the criteria are not met anymore, thereby generating the same notifications every hour, unnecessarily filling the notification inbox and database with data.

This issue also applies to the other cron jobs declared in `src/notifications/notifications.service.ts`.

**Notification endpoints:**

The backend endpoints `notifications/test/*` allow for triggering the notification checks manually for all users. This allows for malicious API users (without any credentials) to spam the endpoint with these notification requests. This will cause the backend to possibly generate multiple notifications per request that are all stored in the database. These endpoints are defined in the file `src/notifications/notifications.controller.ts`.

## Recommendation
Cron jobs:
Update a timestamp per notification type that is used to prevent the same notifications from being generated more than once in a given period of time.

Notification endpoints:
Remove the notification endpoints.

### No notifications are being created for multi-release escrows

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

- `checkCompletedMilestones`

## Recommendation
Update these methods to also generate notifications for multi-release escrows for consistent behaviour.

### Use of floating-point number type for critical values

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The codebase makes extensive use of the JavaScript primitive type `number`, which is a double-precision 64-bit floating point number. Due to the floating-point implementation, the `number` type is prone to rounding errors by nature. Simply parsing a numerical string to a number may round the number upwards or downwards, typically for very large or very small numbers.

Due to this, other types and classes should be used to handle critical numbers. For example, the JavaScript primitive type `bigint`, typically called a BigInt value/object, can be used to precisely store integers. As JavaScript offers no equivalent for non-integer arbitrary-precision numbers, a library must be used that implements similar functionality for such cases.

**Dangerous usage of number**

The codebase dangerously uses `number` to store and calculate critical values such as e.g.:
- `src/stellar-contract/escrow/Dto/fund-escrow.dto.ts:17`: monetary value `amount`
- `src/utils/parse.utils.ts:21`: currency conversion using imprecise floating-point arithmetic

## Recommendation
Review the codebase in regard to usage of `number` and replace `number` with a precise equivalent such as e.g. `BigInt`. Ensure that all arithmetic operations are precise and round towards the correct direction in case rounding is unavoidable. Ensure that serialization and deserialization of numerical values incurs no critical loss of precision.

### API key does not meet security standards

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The backend uses JWT for user session authorization and additionally supports API keys. However, the API keys are currently not used anywhere in the codebase for actual authorization, which makes them serve no purpose. All endpoints that require authorization currently make use of the JWT token.

The API key can be added to a user account by using the `user/:id/api-key` endpoint and supplying the key in the body. Currently, this endpoint is not protected with proper authentication and authorization, as described in [TS03] Missing Authentication Guards on Critical Endpoints. There also exist other endpoints that similarly allow for adding API keys. Removal of API keys is supposed to happen by supplying an empty array, as described in the comment at `src/repositories/user.repository.ts:140`.

The API keys are saved verbatim in the database. This means that API keys can be retrieved in plain text if an attacker gains read access to the database.

There is no format enforced that the API keys must comply with, other than sometimes enforcing them to be strings. The endpoint `auth/request-api-key` overrides all API keys of the given user with a single API key that is identical to the JWT token used for user session authorization. This endpoint is also not protected, currently allowing anyone to override the configured API keys. Additionally, this unsecured endpoint returns the user data including the generated API key.

**Violated security standards for API keys**

- Verbatim storage of API keys in the database:
  - API keys are expected to be stored in an in-retrievable way by using state-of-the-art cryptographic methods

- Using the user authorization session JWT as an API key:
  - While JWT could be used as an API key, it is critical that user sessions and API keys do not share the same credentials

- API keys are never invalidated after a specified amount of time:
  - API keys should be configurable to be invalid after a specified amount of time or at a given date and time

- The user is allowed to specify the API key themselves:
  - Usually the backend generates an API key for the user for maximum security guarantees of the given API key

- No fixed prefix enforced on the API key:
  - Using a fixed prefix that is shared by all API keys allows for detecting leaked API keys on the internet

## Recommendation
Re-implement the API key mechanisms entirely and follow state-of-the-art recommendations for safe API key handling. Potentially, trusted and verified libraries could be used to ensure that the API key implementation is actually secure. This is especially critical as these implementations typically make use of cryptographic concepts and algorithms that are harder to implement securely.

### Not using synced blockchain state in database

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The backend synchronizes the blockchain state in a database. This allows for fast querying of blockchain data without involving the Stellar API.

In `src/stellar-contract/escrow/shared/shared-escrow.service.ts:246`, the function `simulateReadOnlyCall` is used that uses the Stellar API to simulate a transaction, see `src/stellar-contract/shared/stellar-transaction-builder.service.ts:255`. This data is used in `src/stellar-contract/escrow/shared/shared-escrow.service.ts:56` to query the attribute `decimals` of a smart escrow from blockchain state.

This can be optimized by using the synchronized state in the database instead. Additionally, such an approach does not prevent race conditions or front-running attacks. Instead, the backend must rely on the smart escrow smart contract to prevent any front-running attacks and submit data in a transactional ordering. Therefore, the database state can be used here.

## Recommendation
Replace all non-critical occurrences of querying blockchain state with database queries to synchronized blockchain state in the database. It must be ensured that the database state is synchronized properly with the blockchain.

### API provided values are silently overridden with default values

Severity: Informative  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The backend defines DTO (Data Transfer Objects) that declare the fields and types that can be sent to individual endpoints, typically encoded as JSON in the HTTP body. These values provided by the client are usually transformed and validated in the backend.

Some DTOs fields are silently overridden with default values, e.g.:
- `src/utils/parse.utils.ts:65`
- `src/utils/parse.utils.ts:115`

## Recommendation
Change the endpoints and DTOs to either drop fields that are not required by the backend, or alternatively make use of the currently unused fields and values in the DTOs.

## Status
This finding has been addressed in commit ID [`0843d1b`](https://github.com/Trustless-Work/Trustless-Work-Smart-Escrow/commit/0843d1b).


### Login authentication procedure does not authenticate user

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The backend does not have an endpoint dedicated for user logins that authenticates the respective user and returns a session JWT. Instead, the backend provides the endpoints `/auth/request-api-key`, `/user/:id`, and `/user/create`.

A user can be created with the endpoint `/user/create` without any authentication. Subsequently, a JWT token can be generated and retrieved with the endpoint `/auth/request-api-key` without any authentication (and also no JWT is required to access this endpoint). Subsequently, this JWT can be retrieved with the endpoint `/user/:id` without authentication. These critical endpoints are missing authorization, as described in [TS03] Missing Authentication Guards on Critical Endpoints.

It should be noted that the backend generated API keys are valid JWT tokens that can be used to successfully authenticate with the backend, as described in [TS24] API key does not meet security standards.

Generally, anybody can log in, generate, and retrieve API keys that are valid JWT tokens for authorization, without providing any authentication. Only the respective public wallet address must be provided to the API.

```ts
// src/auth/auth.controller.ts:11
@Post("request-api-key")
async login(@Body() loginUserDto: LoginUserDto) {
  return await this.authService.login(loginUserDto);
}

// src/auth/auth.service.ts:59
async login(loginUserDto: LoginUserDto) {
  const { wallet } = loginUserDto;

  if (!wallet) {
    throw new UnauthorizedException("Wallet is required");
  }

  const firestore = this.firebaseService.getFirestore();
  const usersCollection = firestore.collection("users");
  const user = await usersCollection.doc(wallet).get();

  if (user.data() === undefined)
    throw new UnauthorizedException("User are not registered");

  const token = this.getJwtToken({ wallet: user.data().address });

  await usersCollection.doc(wallet).update({
    apiKey: FieldValue.arrayUnion(token),
  });

  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
  const { id, ...userData } = user.data();
  return userData;
}
```

## Recommendation
A proper authentication procedure must be implemented and mandatory for all endpoints that require authentication such as login and register endpoints.

As users login with their respective wallet, they must authenticate that they are the respective owner of the wallet. This can be properly implemented by following the SEP-10 standard (https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md), as described in the Stellar documentation (https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/apps/wallet/sep10).

Additionally, the generated JWT tokens should not be saved in the database. Instead, whenever the user loses the JWT or the JWT becomes invalid, the user is expected to re-authenticate to get a new JWT.

### The backend relies on data in pendingWriteQueue and getTransaction instead of events and blockchain storage

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Design  
Status: Not addressed by client

The backend provides an API that can be used to fetch smart escrow data from a database instead of the blockchain. The backend ensures that the database is always in sync with the blockchain state. This is currently implemented by requiring all smart escrow creation and mutation transactions to be created by the backend.

The backend stores the data related to the respective transaction in a queue and sends the transaction to the user's client. After the user signed the transaction, the user can either send the signed transaction to the backend, where it is submitted to the blockchain and included in the database, or submit the transaction themselves and only send the respective transaction hash to the backend, where the respective related data is taken from the queue and synchronized with the database. In case the backend receives the transaction hash from the client, it validates whether the transaction was actually submitted to and processed by the blockchain, though only for smart escrow deployment transactions as already described in [TS29] Missing validation whether user-submitted transactions were actually submitted to and processed by the blockchain.

When a user does not deploy the smart escrow with the backend, then the smart escrow is not properly synchronized to the database and cannot be later added to the backend database, thereby denying the user the use of the backend API, even though the smart escrow would pay fees to Trustless Work for the backend API infrastructure.

Additionally, any smart escrow transaction that was not generated by the backend will not be captured, leading to a state where the backend database is not properly in sync with the blockchain.

The backend utilizes the `getTransaction` API endpoint of the Stellar blockchain to confirm the validity of transactions and also to get the contract id from deployment transactions. The Stellar `getTransaction` endpoint only stores transactions for a restricted period of time, the default being 24 hours, see https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/apis/rpc/api-reference/methods/getTransaction. This puts the backend at risk of missing transactions in case of downtime or similar.

## Recommendation
We recommend to replace the `pendingWriteQueue` design choice with a procedure that queries storage state from smart escrows via the Stellar API and syncs the data with the database. This procedure could be run for smart escrows determined via emitted Soroban events that the backend could periodically query for from the Stellar API. Additionally, an API endpoint could be provided to update the state on a specific given smart escrow, in case the events were missed by the backend due to, e.g., downtime. This is because events are similarly to transactions only stored for a restricted amount of time in Stellar API nodes.

This would deliberately also allow the backend to process smart escrows that were not deployed by the backend. Therefore the backend must check that the wasm hash of the smart escrow is valid. Additionally, we recommend to validate the smart escrow storage state for valid storage values. This is because we assume that smart escrows with invalid storage values (bypassing initialization validation) could potentially be deployed by exploiting Soroban's smart escrow upgrade functionality.

## Status
This finding will be fixed in the future version of the protocol which will implement a dedicated blockchain indexer.


### Missing validation whether user-submitted transactions were actually submitted to and processed by the blockchain

Severity: High  
Difficulty: Medium  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The function `updateFromTxHash` at `src/indexer/indexer.service.ts:23` is used to process pending transactions stored in the `pendingWriteQueue` that previously were not yet submitted to and processed by the blockchain. This function is therefore called after either the backend submits a transaction or after a user submits a transaction and notifies the backend through its `/indexer/update-from-txhash` endpoint, providing the transaction hash.

In case the transaction deployed a smart escrow, i.e. `pending.type === "SAVE_ESCROW"`, the function `updateFromTxHash` uses `getTransaction` to retrieve the smart contract address. This is expected to fail if the transaction has not yet been processed by the blockchain, though there is no dedicated check that validates this directly.

In the other case, where the transaction is different from deployment, the transaction, as long as it is available in the `pendingWriteQueue`, is processed and the mirrored blockchain state in the database updated. There is no validation that checks whether the transaction has been processed by the blockchain. This means that users can create transactions (except for deployment) with the backend and then use the `/indexer/update-from-txhash` endpoint to cause the backend to process these transactions without the user ever having to submit the transactions to the blockchain.

Additionally, due to the `finally` in `updateFromTxHash` that removes the respective transaction from the queue, the transaction is always removed from the queue, regardless of whether the transaction was processed by the backend. E.g., it is expected that this might happen when a deployment transaction is processed by `updateFromTxHash` without the blockchain yet having processed the transaction.

## Recommendation
Add proper validation that the transaction that is being processed in `updateFromTxHash` was actually properly processed by the blockchain with `getTransaction`. Additionally, in case the blockchain did not properly or successfully process the transaction, keep the element in the queue. Of course, as previously discussed in [TS01] In-Memory Queue Storage Causing Data Loss and Scaling Issues, there needs to be a mechanism in place that removes elements from the queue after a specified period of time has passed.

### Recommendation: use self-hosted Stellar nodes as the Stellar API endpoint

Severity: Informative  
Status: Not addressed by client

The backend requires a Stellar API endpoint to properly function. In case this API endpoint is hosted by a third-party, this third-party could feed wrong and potentially malicious data to the backend.

## Recommendation
To ensure that data returned by the Stellar API is valid, Stellar nodes could instead be self-hosted. These nodes are then expected to always return valid data, as long as they are hosted securely, properly maintained, and kept up to date.

## Status
This recommendation was already being considered by the client, and will be fixed in the future implementation of the project outside of the scope of this audit.


### set-trustline endpoint uses a private key as an argument

Severity: High  
Difficulty: High  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The endpoint `/helper/set-trustline` can be used to set a trustline on a Stellar wallet. To do so, this endpoint takes as argument the private and public keypair of the user. A transaction is prepared that enables the trustline for the user that is subsequently signed on the backend with the provided private key and submitted to the blockchain.

This is inherently dangerous for end-users, as they are not supposed to share their private key with other third-parties. This pattern also diverges from the rest of the backend codebase, where an unsigned transaction is prepared on the backend and then sent to the users client. The user can then decide on their client whether to sign the transaction after reviewing it.

## Recommendation
We recommend to refactor this endpoint to send an unsigned transaction to the users client, similar to how the other endpoints in the backend operate. There should be no endpoint in the backend that accepts a users private key as an argument.

## Status

### Issued JWT tokens never expire

Severity: Low  
Difficulty: Low  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The JWT tokens that are created by the backend never expire. As the users login with their wallet, it is a possibility that the ownership of wallet might change. Therefore, it would be best-practice to require users to periodically re-authenticate.

```ts
// src/auth/auth.module.ts:13
JwtModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [],
  inject: [],
  useFactory: () => {
     return {
        secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
        signOptions: {},
     };
  },
}),
```

## Recommendation
Add an expiration date to JWT tokens by including the following option with a proper value:

```ts
// src/auth/auth.module.ts:13
JwtModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [],
  inject: [],
  useFactory: () => {
     return {
        secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
        signOptions: {
           expiresIn: 'x', // update 'x' to a proper value
        },
     };
  },
}),
```

### Potentially never-ending loop querying the Stellar API

Severity: High  
Difficulty: High  
Recommended Action: Fix Code  
Status: Addressed by client

The function `signAndSendTransaction` at `src/utils/transaction.utils.ts:100` can be used to sign a transaction in the backend and subsequently submit that transaction to the blockchain. This function waits until the transaction has been successfully processed by the blockchain.

However, this loop may never terminate in case the blockchain does not process the transaction as expected. In that case, the backend would continuously send a request to the Stellar API every 1000 milliseconds.

```ts
do {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  getResponse = await server.getTransaction(response.hash);
} while (getResponse.status === "NOT_FOUND");
```

## Recommendation
Use a timeout or a maximum number of retries before this loop is terminated and an error is returned.
